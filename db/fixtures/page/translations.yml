  body: '<h2>Last revised: April 7, 2022</h2><p>We are World Resources Institute,
    a global research nonprofit headquartered at 10 G Street NE Suite 800, Washington,
    D.C. 20002, USA (together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, “WRI”, “we”, “our”
    or “us”).</p><p>Our organization and network of affiliates spans more than 50
    countries. You may interact with WRI online through various websites, applications
    (including the TerraMatch app), emails, social media pages and other online services
    (collectively, “Services”).</p><p>For each of these Services, this Privacy Policy
    tells you what to expect we’ll do with your personal information when you make
    contact with us or use one of our services. In particular, this Privacy Policy
    explains how:</p><ul><li>we use your personal information when you visit our website,
    communicate with us, or provide us with your personal information in other ways;
    and</li><li>we respect your personal information privacy rights.</li></ul><p>Donor
    privacy: WRI and its affiliates do not sell, share, or trade donors’ names or
    personal information with other entities or send mailings on behalf of other organizations.
    With your permission, on occasion, we may share information with related organizations
    in connection with a particular project or campaign you are interested in. For
    example, if we are co-hosting an event with a partner organization and you sign
    up to attend that event, we may ask your permission to share your contact details
    with our partner. See our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wri.org/donate/donor-privacy-policy"

    Information We Collect</h2><p>We collect different kinds of information from you,
    depending on how you interact with us.</p><p>Online collection: We collect personal
    information from you when you register to receive email communications, make donations,
    apply for jobs, send email inquiries, register for events, or participate in other
    parts of our Services.</p><p>Depending on the Services you interact with, the

    via email or over social media;</li><li>Payment information;</li><li>Location
    information: WRI rarely collects location information about you. In some cases,
    we may ask for information about your location for limited purposes. For example,
    users of the TerraMatch application may enable collection of geolocation information
    on their mobile devices in order to map the boundaries of a proposed tree planting
    project. This location data collected on TerraMatch is not used for any other
    purpose or shared with or sold to third parties;</li><li>Educational and employment
    information (such as your resume or C.V.) that you may provide if you apply for
    a job at WRI;</li><li>Automatically collected information: We and our third-party
    service providers may collect information about your interaction with our Services
    using cookies and similar automatic data-collection technology. We use this information
    to improve and maintain our Services, collect aggregate site usage reports that
    do not identify you individually, and to optimize site users’ experience on the
    Services. The information we collect includes:</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Identifiers

    such as in the event of a material change to our Services, related policies, or
    accounts you create with us.</p><h2>Disclosure of Information</h2><p>Personal
    information is disclosed to the following parties:</p><ul><li>to employees and
    independent contractors of WRI, analytic vendors, payment processing vendors,
    third party agents and other service providers and suppliers if the disclosure
    will enable that party to perform a business, professional, or technical support
    function for WRI or to perform a service that you have requested;</li><li>to and
    between entities within the WRI group;</li><li>where you give us permission to
    disclose your personal information to third parties selected by us in connection
    with our projects and campaigns;</li><li>if we are required to do so to comply

    authority;</li><li>where we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect
    our legal rights or property or the legal rights or property of an individual
    who registers with an WRI service or technology or any third party, or to prevent
    personal injury; and/or</li><li>in connection with a sale, merger, assignment,
    reorganization, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or
    all of our assets or our affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in
    connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li></ul><p>We also disclose
    non-private, aggregate or otherwise non-personal information to third parties,
    including social media companies like Facebook and Twitter for outreach purposes.</p><p>We
    take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information about you that we
    pass to a service provider or other third party will be held securely by that
    party and only be used for the purposes for which it was provided to them. Except
    as noted above, information we collect from WRI website visitors will not be shared
    with individuals or other companies unrelated to WRI, or that do not perform a
    business, professional or technical function for WRI.</p><h2>Security and Quality</h2><p>WRI
    takes reasonable steps to protect the personal information that you provide. We
    use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
    the personal information you provide on secured computer servers that are located
    in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information
    over the internet, we protect it through the use of appropriate technological
    and administrative means.</p><p>We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any
    personal information you supply to us. You can help WRI update and maintain the
    accuracy of any personal information you supply by notifying WRI of any changes
    to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. In some parts of the Services
    you may do this online by following the instructions on membership profile pages.
    You may also do this by using the contact information provided below.</p><p>Transmission
    of information on the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee
    the security of information sent on our Services. Transmission of such information
    is at your own risk.</p><h2>Transfers</h2><p>Where necessary, we may need to transfer
    your personal information to another country. These transfers can take place within
    the WRI group but also may be made to selected third parties (as explained in
    the ‘<a href="https://www.wri.org/about/privacy-policy#disclosure-information"
    rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Disclosure of information’</a> section
    of this Privacy Policy). Such transfers take place to enable us to provide you
    with our services and/or to communicate with you. Countries that we transfer your
    personal information to may not have the same personal information protection
    standards as the country you live in.</p><h2>Links to External Devices</h2><p>WRI’s
    Services may contain links to other websites belonging to third parties. These
    websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for
    the privacy practices within any other website. You should be aware of this when
    you leave a WRI area, including our websites, and we encourage you to read the
    privacy statements of other websites.</p><h2>Personal Information Access and Deletion</h2><p>You
    may request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to have any
    inaccuracies corrected. You may also request that we delete the information we
    hold about you. Please address requests (with a return email address where possible)

    a machine-readable format or to have your personal information sent to another
    company.</p><h2>Donation Processing Partner</h2><p>WRI has partnered with a third-party
    service provider, iATS Payments, to process your online donations. Where you make
    a donation to WRI online, your personal information will be shared between WRI
